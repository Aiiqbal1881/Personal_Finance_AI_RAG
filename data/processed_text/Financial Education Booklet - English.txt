Chapter 2 - Key Concepts in personal finance 
 
Some important concepts in personal finance which an individual should be aware of while 
managing their personal finances are mentioned as below: 
 
What are Savings? 
Savings are the surplus of income over expenditure.  
 
a. Income- Money earned from various sources like Salary, Wages, etc. 
 
b. Expenditure- Money spent on various items which include essential and non -
essential items. 
 
People usually meet their short term goals with savings.  Money in savings account of a 
bank earns a small amount of interest and it is easy to withdraw it whenever needed. 
People can save in savings bank accounts, Post Office savings accounts, etc. 
 
What are Investments? 
Investment is the act of deployment of money out of savings 
into financial or non-financial products with the expectation of 
earning higher returns over a period of time. The various 
products in which investments may be done are financial 
products viz. fixed deposit in bank, buying shares in stock 
market, investing in Mutual fu nds, etc. and non -financial 
products viz. purchase of land, gold, silver , etc. The 
investments may be done for short term, medium term or long-
term. While investing one should always remember that return on investments may rise 
or fall over time and it is quite normal for that to happen.  
 
Difference between Savings and Investments is mentioned in the table below: 
 
 Savings in Bank 
Accounts 
Investment in Fixed Deposits 
and other financial products 
Meaning A portion of one’s income 
which is not used for 
expenses. 
Putting your money in various 
investment products to make 
money grow. 
Purpose Savings are made to maintain 
liquidity to meet short term or 
urgent requirements. 
Investments are made to make the 
money grow by creating assets that 
can generate income i n the 
future/increase value of assets. 
Risk Low or negligible Depends upon the asset in which 
investment is done. 
Liquidity Highly liquid Comparatively less liquid

What is the importance of saving and investing? 
Investing money makes it grow for you. Any increase in the value of the investment over 
a period of time, or investment income/returns that you receive, gets you that much closer 
to your financial goals. One should start saving and investing early in his or her life. The 
earlier you start, the better you will be placed in meeting your goals like owning a house, 
financing your child's education, funding for your retirement, etc. 
 
What are Assets and Liabilities? 
Items that you own and have economic value are your assets and 
items which you owe to others or have borrowed from others are 
your liabilities. For example, if you save and then invest in a fixed 
deposit, it is your asset. On the other hand, if you borrow funds/ 
take a loan from a bank or any individual, it is your liability.  
 
What is Debt? 
Money borrowed to meet shortfall of money when expenses are more than  the funds 
available in hand is called debt. 
 
What is the Time Value of Money? 
As time passes, you will realize that if 10 years back you 
could afford to purchase a full lunch for a particular amount 
of money, then today you could afford to get only a portion 
of the lunch in that amount of money. This means that the 
value of a five-hundred-rupee note would be higher today 
than after five years. Although the note is the same, you 
can do  much more with the money if you ha ve it now 
because over a period, you can make the money grow by earning interest on the money. 
By receiving ₹500/- today, you can increase the future amount of your money by investing 
the money and gaining interest or capital appreciation over a period of time.  
 
At the most basic level, the time value of money shows that time literally is money, i.e. the 
value of the money you have now is not the same as it will be in the future and vice versa. 
 
What is Inflation and its effect on Investments? 
Inflation refers to rise in prices of goods and services. Over  a period of time, as the cost 
of goods and services incre ases, the ability of a unit of money, say one rupee, to buy 
goods and services keeps declining. In other words, the Purchasing Power of money, i.e. 
ability of money to buy anything, decreases. It is important to take into account the effects 
of inflation on your investments during financial planning. Investors greatly fear inflation 
since it reduces the value of their investment. 
 
How does inflation affect my investment decision? 
A Vada Pav costing ₹2/- five years ago would now cost ₹7/-. This increase in the price is 
not as a result of higher quantity or a better quality of the Vada  Pav, but due to inflation 
impacting the prices of the ingredients and finally the end product.  

Financial Education Booklet 
7 | P a g e  
 
What are the steps that you can take to avoid the adverse effects of inflation? 
Try to determine your "real rate of return”,  or the return you can expect after factoring in 
the effects of inflation. To reduce the risk of decrease in the value of money, you can 
invest the money available to you today at a rate equal or higher than the rate of inflation. 
 
What is Power of Compounding? 
With simple interest, you can earn interest only on the principal (that is, the amount you 
initially invested); while with compounding interest, you earn interest on the principal as 
well as, previously earned interest. 
 
Let us understand the magic of compounding with the help of an example. 
Year Principal Rate of 
return Return earned Maturity 
value 
1 1 ,000 9% 90 1,090 
2 1 ,090 
(1000+ interest earned of  90) 9% 98 1,188 
3 1,188 
(1,000+interest earned 90+98) 9% 295 1295 
10  2,172 9% 195 2,367* 
20 5,142 9% 463 5,604 
40 28,816 9% 2,593 31,409 
 
*Principal amount is changing at the end of every year on account of addition of return 
earned for that year to the principal. As principal is increasing every year, the return earned 
on increased principal also is increasing. 
 
The above example shows how an initial investment of ₹1,000/- grows to ₹31,409/- over 
a period of 40 years. When the return is reinvested, you earn a return on the previously 
earned return and so on.  Whereas in case of simple interest, the principle amount remains 
at ₹1,000/- only for all the 40 years and with annual interest of ₹90/-, the amount grows to 
only ₹4,600/-. 
 
Note: 
­ Principal + return from the first year collectively becomes the principal for the 
second year. 
­ Principal + return from the second year collectively becomes the Principal for the 
third year and so on.

The Rule of 72 
Mathematicians say that you can find out how long it 
will take you to double your money simply by dividing 
the number 72 by the interest rate. So let's say your 
parents give you ₹200/- for your birthday and you plan 
to invest it. If you put the money into an account that 
earns 6 percent (6%) interest a year, how long will it 
take to grow to ₹400/-/? 
 
72 / 6% interest = 12 years 
So in 12 years, your money will have doubled to ₹400/-. 
 
Rupee Cost Averaging 
Rupee cost av eraging is the process in which you invest a fixed amount of money at 
regular intervals irrespective of market fluctuations. For example, you buy more units when 
unit prices are low and less units when unit prices are high. By investing according to a 
schedule, you avoid the complex or even impossible duty of trying to figure out the exact 
best time to invest. The rupee cost averaging effect averages out the costs of your units 
and hence lessens the impact of short-term market fluctuations on your investments. For 
example, look at the table below: 
 
Month Amount Paid Cost per unit Number of units bought 
(Amount paid / Cost) 
Jan 2000 50.00 40 
Feb 2000 41.67 48 
Mar 2000 47.62 42 
Apr 2000 58.82 34 
May 2000 71.42 28 
Jun 2000 66.67 30 
Divide the rule number (72) by the annual 
interest rate (R) to find out the approximate time 
(T) required for doubling your money.

Total 24,000  466 units 
 
From the above, it can be seen that with a total investment of ₹24,000/- over a period of 
twelve months, an investor received 466 units of Mutual fund. The average price per unit 
comes to ₹51.50/- (i.e. ₹24,000/466 = ₹51.50/-).

Chapter 3 - Financial Planning 
 
A. Financial Planning 
Financial planning is the process of  estimating financial needs of a person and 
implementing a comprehensive plan to meet those financial needs during his or her 
lifetime through investment. For instance, birth of a child, education, purchasing house, 
marriage, meeting emergency situations like an illness, to meet the impact of an accident, 
death, or natural calamities like flood, etc.  
 
B. Financial Planning Process 
 
 
 
Determine Your Current Financial Situation 
If you want to plan for the future, you need to understand your current financial p osition. 
You need to understand what your incomes, expenses, assets and liabilities/debts are? 
Your net worth is simply assets you own minus liabilities you owe.  
 
The net worth is calculated as under: - 
Assets Liabilities 
Particulars Amount in Rupees Particulars Amount in Rupees 
Car 25,000 House Loan 20,00,000 
Bank 
Balance 5,00,000 Car Loan 10,000 
House 50,00,000   
Total Assets 55,25,000 Total Liabilities 20,10,000 
Net Worth 
(Assets-
Liabilities) 
35,15,000/- (55,25,000-20,10,000) 

Financial Education Booklet 
11 | P a g e  
 
Your net worth indicates your capacity to achieve your financial goals, such as buying a 
home, paying for university education, future medical expenses, repayment of loan, etc. 
 
Develop Financial Goals 
Your financial goals can range from acquiring assets, saving 
for emergency as well as making investments for your future 
financial security. The financial goals of an individual can be 
categorized as below: 
a. Basic financial goals (food, clothing, shelter, etc.) 
b. Secondary or advanced financial goals (education, 
house, marriage, etc.) 
c. Retirement planning  
d. Estate planning  
 
Individuals can use a variety of investment, risk management and tax planning strategies 
to meet their financial goals. These goals change over an individual's lifetime and 
accordingly the financial plan should be reviewed on a regular basis for any modification 
as per change in the circumstances. 
 
TIP: While making financial plans, one should first ensure a planned savings amount 
and then plan for meeting expenses. 
 
Mr. Warren Buffett, one of world’s successful investor, has said: - “Don’t save what is 
left after spending; spend what is left after saving.” 
 
Therefore, the basic concept that everyone should focus upon while utilising his income 
is as follows: 
Income – Savings = Expenditure 
 
Wealth is not built ove rnight. One needs to set specific financial goals. A good financial 
goal should be SMART i.e. Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Realistic and Time -
bound. 
 
 Description Incorrect Approach Right Approach 
Specific You need to know 
exactly what you 
want to ac hieve 
and when you want 
it. 
I need to set aside 
money for my grand 
daughter's birthday 
next year. 
I need to set aside ₹ 
10,000/- for my grand 
daughter's birthday next

Measurable A goal should be 
measurable so that 
you know when you 
will achieve it. 
I will pay off most of my 
credit card dues soon. 
In the next six months, I 
will pay off all my credit 
card bills in full. 

Financial Education Booklet

Achievable Your goal should be 
within a reasonable 
reach. 
I will save money. I will save ₹ 48,000/- 
every year by setting  
aside ₹ 4,000/- every 
month. 
Realistic Your goals need to 
be based on 
resources and 
tasks that you can 
reasonably 
achieve. 
By saving regularly, I 
will become a 
millionaire. 
By saving regularly, I 
will be debt free by 
January next year. If I 
continue saving 
regularly after clearing 
all my debt, by next 
December I will be 
saving the sufficient  
amount to fund  six 
months of my living 
expenses. 
Time-bound Goals with timelines 
allow you to track 
your progress and 
encourage you to 
keep going until you 
reach your goal. 
I will save money for 
my daughter's 
marriage. 
I will save ₹ 50,000/- 
every year for next 10 
years for my daughter's 
marriage. 
 
Goal-based investing focuses on meeting goals that are personal and specific. The focus 
of this approach is to arrive at future value of different goals and then pursuing these goals 
through asset allocation made for investments according to each individual’s financial 
goal. To adopt this strategy while investing, one must plan as per one's age, risk appetite 
(ability to take risk), financial situation and investment horizon. 
 
Five-Step Approach to Achieve Financial Goals 
 
STEP 1: Identify specific financial goals 
It is important to prepare a proper plan to fix each investment with a specific goal. It is very 
important to identify one ’s financial goals and aspirations and estimate the amount of 
money it would be needed to fulfil them. 
 
STEP 2: Classify goals into Short-term, Medium term or Long term 
• Short-term goals are typically financial requirements that are expected to arise in 
time period ranging from a few months to one year.  
• Medium-term goals may have a time horizon of one year to eight years. Goals like 
buying a property, starting your own venture, getting enrolled in a professional course, 
etc. can be medium-term financial goals.  
• Long-term goals may have a time horizon of eight years or more for example child's 
marriage, retirement planning, etc. 
Financial Education Booklet 
13 | P a g e  
 
STEP 3: Decide upon asset-allocation 
Asset-Allocation is a strategy for investing your money into various asset classes such as 
equity and debt that would suit an investor's income and risk appetite. Asset Classes may 
be referred to groups of financial instruments which have similar financial characteristics.  
Asset Allocation refers to an investment strategy that aims to balance risk and reward - in 
the form of returns - by dividing the assets of an individual’s portfolio according to his/her 
financial goals, risk tolerance and investment horizon. 
 
Asset Allocation 
Allocate assets depending on your age, lifestyle, family commitments an d your financial 
goals. While allocating your funds, distribute your investments across various asset  
classes such as equity, bonds, real estate, etc., to benefit from diversification, which helps 
reduce risk and increases the possibility of earning modera te to high returns on your 
investments. 
 
For example: An individual’s portfolio when he/she invest s in 
various asset classes (depending upon his financial goals, risk 
appetite, investment horizon, etc.) may look like any of the 
following:  
   
STEP 4: Choose the right investments with diversification (within asset classes) 
Arriving at the right risk -return combination and choosing the right asset allocation can 
seem difficult. For a longer term goal, it is advisable to focus on maximizing returns with 
diversified asset allocation. 
 
Diversification 
It refers to the process which reduces risk by making investments into various financial 
instruments, industries and other categories. It aims to minimize loss on return by investing 
in different asset classes (debt, equity, gold, real assets, etc.) that would react differently 
to the same event, such as those relating to the economy or markets. 
 
Although diversification does not provide guarantee against loss, it is the most important 
component for reaching long-term financial goals while minimizing risk.

TIP: 
 
 Don't put all eggs (invest  all your money) in one 
basket (asset class). 
 Diversification is doing investment in various 
financial instruments or asset classes. 
 Goal is to find an appropriate b alance between 
risk and return. 
 
STEP 5: Review and revise financial plans 
To stay on track, regularly review the progress towards your goals and investments. 
Review your investments like stocks and mutual funds in your portfolio. Certain products 
may seem tailor -made for specific needs, but they may not be actually useful for one's 
portfolio. Be aware of such investment options. 
 
C. Choosing Investment Options & Understanding Risk 
The investment products available for an investor are fixed income securities, equity 
investments, mutual funds, etc. Every asset class has its own risk and return. Investments 
in equities are considered as high risk investments as their returns are subject to 
performance of individual companies and general economic scenario. On the other hand, 
investments in the debt instruments are considered having relatively low risk.  
 
For instance, Government bonds are considered to be effectively "risk free" due to the 
trust that government will not default on the repayment to investors. 
 
Three pillars of investment - The investment decision by an individual is influenced by 
safety, liquidity and return. They are called the three pillars of investment. 
 
i. Safety: This is about how well protected the 
principal and return on the investment is. For 
instance, if you lend ₹100/- to someone, will it 
be repaid on time? Or, is your capital of ₹100/- 
safe? Safety means your money invested is 
protected and there is every possibility that on 
the agreed date, or maybe even before, it 
would be returned whenever needed. 
 
ii. Liquidity: This pillar of investment is the degree of ease with which you can en -
cash or liquidate your investment at fair value. In the above example, it will be 
about how soon will you get your money back if you need it immediately? 
 
iii. Return: What is the return you will get on your investments? It could be in the form 
of income, appreciation of capital invested or both. Income means an investment's 
earnings in the form of interest or dividend payment. Capital appreciation means 
the increase in market value of investment over a period of time.  
Safety
ReturnLiquidilty
Financial Education Booklet

For example, if the present market value is higher than the value at the time of investment, 
it is called appreciation or gain. In case the market value is lower than the value at the 
time of investment, it is called depreciation or loss. 
 
D. Returns from Investment 
Returns from Investment can be described as money made by an investor on his/ her 
investment. The returns can be in two ways as explained below: 
 
Regular Income 
 
• Equity Investment: You get dividend when you b uy and hold equity shares of a 
company and units of equity mutual fund. 
 
• Fixed Income Investment: In debt securities, you receive fixed interest on interest 
bearing Investments 
 
Capital Appreciation 
• When the value of initial investment increases over a per iod of time and the investor 
benefits by selling part or whole of the investment at the increased value, it is called 
Capital Appreciation. 
 
Example of Capital Appreciation: An investor bought 100 shares of company XYZ Ltd. 
at ₹50/- per share by paying ₹5,000/- in total. When the value of XYZ share increases to 
₹65/- per share, and the investor sells 100 shares in the market, he or she will get 6,500 
(100 Shares at ₹65/- per share). The investor stands to gain ₹1500/- from the i nitial 
investment that he has made. This is called capital appreciation/capital gain. 
 
E. What are Risks and Returns? 
Risk can be defined as the probability or likelihood of a loss occurring in relation to your 
expected returns from any particular investment. It is a measure of the level of uncertainty 
of achieving the returns as per investor expectations. 
 
Risk V/S Return 
 
 
Risk and investing go hand in hand. The good news is that "risk" comes with the potential 
for "rewards" from investing — which is what makes the whole process worthwhile.

Tips: 
 Once you invest in any asset class you should monitor your 
investments on a regular basis and keep yourself updated about 
various market happenings to take corrective action. 
 Always check the potential risks and do proper due diligence when 
promised returns are usually high.

Chapter 4 - Savings Related Products 
 
In this chapter, we will discuss about the various savings related products available to the 
public. These include deposit schemes offered by banks, government d eposit schemes, 
public deposits issued by companies, etc. 
 
A. Why to keep money in banks? 
Drawbacks of keeping cash at home are mentioned as below: 
 
• Unsafe – Money can be stolen or lost due to natural calamities 
• Loss of growth opportunities - Loss of interest income 
• No/Low credit eligibility - Deposit in banks creates eligibility for taking loans 
 
Therefore, it is beneficial to keep money in banks rather than at home in cash. 
 
B. Banking 
Commercial banks are regulated financial institutions as 
they deal with pub lic money and trust. Commercial 
banks in India are regulated by Reserve Bank of India. 
Banks are required to go through mandatory inspection 
and audits at various intervals and are also audited by 
the Reserve Bank of India every year.  
 
Bank deposits are c omparatively lower risk investments. Banks offer various types of 
deposits, depending on the needs of the customers. Bank deposits are preferred more for 
their liquidity and safety than for the returns. It is also possible to get loans from banks 
against fixed deposits up to 75 to 90 % of the deposit amount. 
 
Central Government deposit insurance scheme ensures that all deposits are insured by 
the Government up to a limit of ₹5 lakhs per customer in that particular bank. So, even in 
case of a failure of a bank, depositors are assured that the Government will step in and 
return up to ₹5 lakhs of their savings in that bank. For complete details on the scheme, 
one can refer the website of Reserve Bank of India, from time to time. 
 
C. Account Opening Process — Know Your Client (KYC) Norms 
For opening any type of bank account, customers need 
to undergo the process of complying with KYC norms. 
KYC Stands for "Know Your Customer". The objective of 
KYC is to enable banks to know and understand their 
customers better and help them manage their risks 
prudently. The KYC documents generally accepted by 
banks are: Photograph, Document for proof of identity 
(copy of PAN Card, Aadhaar Card, etc. ) and Document for proof of address (copy of 
electricity bill, driving license, passport, Aadhaar card, etc).

 Don't write down your PIN number anywhere. Memorize it. Don't disclose your PIN 
number to any third person. 
 Preferably use an ATM within bank premises or premises which are manned 24*7 by 
a security guard. Use it pers onally. Bank has no liability in case the ATM card has 
been handed over for transaction to any other person except the account holder. 
 While using the online transaction, use the virtual keyboard. 
 Register yourself with bank for getting SMS alerts on trans actions. However, banks

 Change your PIN numbers as often as convenient. 
 If the card is lost, immediately inform the bank. 
 Do not allow anyone to access or use your card.  
 
H. Customer Liability for unauthorized banking transactions 
RBI has specified that a customer has no liability when an unauthorized transaction 
happens on account of fraud, contributory negligence or deficiency on part of the bank. 
Similarly, even when ne ither the customer nor the bank is at fault, but the problem lies 
elsewhere in the system, the customer does not have any liability, provided he/she notifies 
the bank about the unauthorized or illegal operation within three days of receiving an alert 
from the bank. And the bank shall credit the amount involved in such transaction to the 
customer's account within a specified time period. However, in cases where such fraud 
takes place on account of the negligence of the customer, the entire loss, until the date of 
reporting the unlawful transaction, will be borne by the customer. 
 
RBI has emphasized banks that they need to send SMS and e-mail alerts to the customers 
immediately after a transaction is carried out in their account. They have been instructed 
to ensure that such messages are enabled to carry the customer's reply too, so that a 
customer can report any such fraud immediately.

Chapter 5 - Investment in Securities Market 
 
Before investing in securities, it is better to 
understand the market and be fully aware of the 
risks involved. Be aware of your capacity to handle 
risk and inves t accordingly. Generally, you can 
evaluate a potential investment by analysing seven 
key risks as mentioned below: 
 
Types of Risks 
 
i. Market risk or Systematic Risk 
An investor may experience losses due to factors affecting the overall performance 
of financ ial markets and macroeconomic factors. Stock market bubbles and 
crashes are good examples of heightened market risk. 
 
ii. Unsystematic Risk 
Unsystematic risk can be described as the uncertainty inherent in a particular 
company or industry. Examples of unsystem atic risk include a new competitor in 
the marketplace with the potential to take significant market share from the 
company an investor is invested in, a regulatory change, such as one that could 
drive down company sales, a shift in management, a product recall, etc. 
 
iii. Inflation risk 
Inflation risk, also called as purchasing power risk, is the chance that the cash flows 
from an investment won't be worth as much in the future as they are today because 
of a decline in its purchasing power due to inflation. 
 
iv. Liquidity risk 
Liquidity risk arises when an investment cannot be bought or sold or converted into 
cash quickly enough to prevent or minimize a loss  or to meet any immediate

expense. You can minimize this risk to a great extent by diversifying your 
investments. 
 
v. Business Risk 
It refers to the risk that a business might stop its operations due to any unfavourable 
market or financial situation. 
 
vi. Volatility Risk 
It refers to the risk when the stock prices of a company may fluctuate, e ven when 
those companies aren't in danger of failing. 
 
vii. Currency Risk 
Currency risk arises when there is a possibility of losing money due to unfavourable 
movements in exchange rates. It may happen from change in price of one currency 
in relation to other and investors who have assets across national borders are 
exposed to this risk. 
 
How to mitigate the risk? 
The investors can try to mitigate the risk by different means. Asset allocation is one 
strategy through which an investor can benefit from diversification of their investments into 
various sectors and companies to mitigate risk.  
 
Volatility risk can be managed by investing through Systematic Investment Plan of Mutual 
Funds or buying equities directly from the market in smaller lots over a period  of time. A 
good understanding of the fundamentals of a company can help one make an appropriate 
judgment about the health of a company. Of course, investors should ignore the rumours 
and unsolicited messages for investing in securities market. 
 
Investments in securities market are done through primary market as well as secondary 
market. The difference between primary market and secondary market is that in the 
primary market, investors are allotted securities directly by the company, while in the 
secondary market investors buy securities from the existing investors through their stock 
brokers. Investments in securities market are subject to taxation , which includes short 
term and long term tax on capital gains as well as dividend pay-outs. 
 
What are the pre-requisites to invest in securities? 
In order to invest in equity shares, an investor should have three accounts: 
 
• Savings Account – Saving bank account with a commercial bank 
• Trading Account  - Trading account with a SEBI registered stock broker of a 
recognized stock exchange to buy or sell securities on the Stock Exchange 
• Demat Account - Demat account with a SEBI recognized Depository Participant 
(DP) of Depository for holding securities in dematerialized/electronic form 
Financial Education Booklet 
25 | P a g e  
 
The Demat account can be opened with depository participant (DP) of any of the 
Depository. National Securities Depository Ltd. (NSDL) and Central Depository Services 
(India) Ltd. (CDSL) are two SEBI registered depositories in India. 
 
The list of SEBI registered stock brokers and depository participants may be obtained from 
SEBI’s official website (www.sebi.gov.in) or from the websites of the respective stock 
exchanges & depositories. 
 
Primary Market 
When a company publicly issues new stocks and bonds for the first time, it does so in the 
primary market. In many cases, this take s the fo rm of an initial public offer  (IPO). SEBI 
examines the prospectus issued to the public for subscription of shares to see that it meets 
with the requirements of the SEBI Regulations. Companies issuing securities via the 
primary market hire merchant bankers who, on behalf of the company, prepare the 
prospectus and ensure related compliance for the issue of shares viz. finalization of 
allotment process, listing of shares in the stock exchanges, etc. 
 
Application Supported by Blocked Amount (ASBA) for Shares 
An investor can now apply for shares in the primary market through ASBA. In public issues 
w.e.f. May 01, 2010 all the investors can apply through ASBA. ASBA is an application by 
an investor containing an authorization to the bank to block the applica tion money in his/ 
her bank account, for subscribing to an issue. Blocked amount continues to earn interest. 
If an investor is applying through ASBA, his application money shall be debited from the 
bank account only if his/her application is selected for a llotment, after the basis of 
allotment is finalized. The investor need not have to bother about refunds as money to the 
extent required for allotment of securities, is deducted from the bank account and in case 
the securities are not allotted to the invest or, then the blocked amount in his/ her bank 
account is released and made available to use. 
 
Unified Payment Interface (UPI) in ASBA 
A new feature of utilizing Unified Payment Interface (UPI) while making payment in ASBA, 
has also been introduced recently. This feature may be used for the purpose of blocking 
of funds and making payments in the public issue process. This requires the investors to 
create a UPI ID and PIN using any of the UPI enabled mobile application. Usage of UPI 
in public issue process bri ngs in comfort, ease of use and reduces the listing time for 
public issues.

Secondary Market 
Secondary market is the market where securities are traded after the company has issued 
the stocks and bonds in the primary market. The shares are listed and traded on the stock 
exchanges which facilitates the buying and selling of stocks in the secondary market. 
Major SEBI recognized stock exchanges in India are BSE Ltd. (formerly Bombay Stock 
Exchange Ltd.) and the National Stock Exchange of India Ltd. (NSE). 
 
Anyone can purchase securities on the secondary market as long as they are willing to 
pay the price at which the securities are being traded. Investment in securities market 
should be done after carrying out research on the background of the company, future 
prospects and financial strength of the company. 
 
Know Your Client (KYC) 
For the purpose of opening of Demat and trading 
account with a D epository Participant (DP)/Stock 
broker, the investor has to complete Know Your 
Client (KYC) process with the respective DP/Stock 
Broker. KYC is mandatory under the Prevention of 
Money Laundering Act, 2002 and Rules framed 
there under. Investor has to submit Officially Valid 
Documents (OVDs) as proof of identity and proof 
of address such as PAN card / Unique Identification (UID) (Aadhaar)/ Passport/ Voter ID 
card/ Driving license, etc. KYC process may be done online through Aadhaar based E -
KYC mechanism or offline by visiting or sending the documents to the registered address 
of the intermediary.

Trading days and Trading & Settlement Cycle 
Trading on the stock exchange takes place on all days of the week (except Saturdays and 
Sundays and holidays declared by the Stock Exchange in advance). 
 
In case of purchase of shares, investors are required to make payment to the bank 
account of you r stock broker prior to the pay -in day for the relevant settlement. Once 
payment is made by the investor, the broker would credit the shares in the Demat account 
of investor after pay-out day. 
 
Similarly, in case of sale of shares, investors are required t o deliver the shares to Demat 
account of broker prior to the pay-in day for the relevant settlement. Once the shares are 
delivered by the investor, the broker would credit the funds in the bank account of investor 
after pay-out day. 
 
What is the pay-in day and pay-out day?  
Pay-in day is the day when the brokers shall make payment of funds (in case of purchase 
of shares) or delivery of securities (in case of sale of shares) to the stock exchange. Pay-
out day is the day when the stock exchange makes payment of funds (in case of sale of 
shares) or delivery of securities (in case of purchase of shares) to the broker. Settlement 
cycle is on T+2 rolling settlement basis w.e.f. April 01, 2003 (where T stands for the trade 
day). For example, trades executed on a Mo nday are typically settled on the following 
Wednesday (considering 2 working days from the trade day). The funds and securities 
pay-in and pay-out are carried out on T+2 day. 
 
The exchanges have to ensure that the pay -out of funds and securities to the cli ents is 
done by the broker within 24 hours of the pay-out. 
 
Margin and Pledging / Re-pledging of securities 
When an investor buys a stock, he has two options, i.e. 
 
 to pay the entire price of the stock upfront, called early pay in or  
 to pay only a certain percentage of the price of the stock and borrow money from the 
broker to finance the rest. The percentage of the price of the stock paid upfront is 
called margin. The payment of the remaining amount can be made by the designated 
pay-out time. 
 
Similarly, when an investor desires to sell his stocks he has the option to either pay in the 
shares to be sold or can give a margin upfront. Margin can be provided in the form of cash 
or instruments like  fixed deposits, bank guarantee, securities, units of mutual fu nds, 
government securities and treasury bills in demat form.  
 
Margin is provided in the form of securities, in favour of the broker only in the form of 
pledge. A pledge is a deposit of some personal property as collateral for a debt. Stock 
Brokers can accept securities (viz shares) as collateral only in the form of margin pledge 
created on the securities held in client’s demat account. Investor (client) needs to give 
Financial Education Booklet 
29 | P a g e  
 
instructions to create margin pledge on securities. This instruction can be in physical form 
or electronically through “SPEED-e” (for NSDL) and “Easiest” (for CDSL). 
 
Contract Note 
A Contract Note is evidence of trade done by the stock broker given to the investor and is 
a legal document which contains details of the transaction such as securities bought/sold, 
traded price, time of trade, brokerage, etc. Contract Notes can be issued in physical form 
or in electronic form. In case investor opts for electronic contract note, a specific 
authorization needs to be given to the stock broker along with  the details of email of the 
investor. Such electronic contract notes shall be digitally signed and encrypted which 
would make them difficult to be tampered. 
 
Basic Services Demat Account (BSDA) 
SEBI with a view to achieve wider financial inclusion, 
encourage holding of demat accounts . In order to 
reduce the cost of maintaining securities in demat 
accounts for retail individual investors , SEBI has 
made available a Basic Services Demat Account"

combination of these investments. All mutual funds are required to be registered with SEBI 
before they launch any scheme.  
 
Salient features of mutual funds are: 
 Professional management - Money is invested through fund managers with proven 
expertise in the field of investment. 
 
 Diversification - Diversification is an investing strategy that can be summed up as 
investing small amounts of your money in different investment options like different 
schemes of mutual funds and holding shares of multiple companies. 
 
 Economy of scale - A mutual fund buys and sells large amount of securities at one 
go. This makes its transaction cost lower than what an individual would pay for 
securities transactions. 
 
 Liquidity - Just like individual shares, mutual fund units can be converted into money 
through sale in the market or through redemption. 
 
 Simplicity - Buying a mutual fund unit is simple and the minimum investment amount 
required is small. 
 
 Tax Benefits  - Different mutual fund categories are subjected to different tax 
treatments. It is important to understand the tax benefits of a fund before you invest in 
it. 
 
Mutual funds are segregated in different categories 
based on the objectives of the mutual fund scheme. 
The schemes are designed to keep in mind the needs 
of various types of investors, risk averse in vestors 
(basically a conservative Investor who does not want 
to take high risk), moderate investors (investors who 
can take some amount of risk) and aggressive 
investors (investors who are willing to take risk in 
search of higher returns). 
 
 
Categorization of Mutual Funds 
Mutual funds are broadly categorized into five schemes mentioned as below:

What is Systematic Investment Plan (SIP)? 
An SIP or a Systematic Investment Plan allows an investor to invest a fixed amount of 
money regularly in a mut ual fund scheme. It lets you set aside a fixed sum of money at 
regular intervals (weekly, monthly  or quarterly) with an objective to gain capital 
appreciation in the longer run. SIP investment inculcates the habit of savings. Instead of 
trying to time the market, by investing on a regular basis, the investor benefits from the

rupee-cost averaging factor. As the investments are done over different market cycles, 
the investor benefits from the market volatility by getting to buy more units of the same 
fund when the markets are low and buying less units when the prices are high. 
 
An investor can invest a pre-determined fixed amount as low as ₹500/- in a scheme every 
month or quarter, depending on his/her convenience through post-dated cheques, through 
Standing instruction (SI) facility or  through ECS (Electronic Clearing Service) facility. 
Investors need to fill up an application form and SIP mandate form on which they need to 
indicate their choice for the SIP date (basically when the pre -determined amount will be 
invested). Subsequent SIP s may be auto -debited through a standing instruction , 
electronic clearing service or post-dated cheques.

What is Commodity Price Risk? 
Commodity price risk is the price uncertainty that adversely impacts the financial position 
of those who both use and produce commodities. For example, as the price of steel rises, 
this increases the cost of automobile production and can negatively impact that producer's 
profit margins. Similarly, commodity price risk can equally impact producers of a 
commodity, not just users. If crop prices are low one year, a farmer may plant less of that 
crop. If prices subsequently rise next year, the farmer will  miss out on a potentially 
profitable crop. This is called commodity price risk. The factors that can affect commodity 
prices include political and regulatory changes, seasonal variations, weather, technology 
and market conditions. 
 
Risk Faced by Various Stakeholders 
Various stakeholders face many risks in commodity trading, especially farmers, such as: 
 Price volatility and price risk 
 Lack of quality storage facilities 
 Need for finance at the time of sowing of crops 
 Dependence on local middlemen and agents for selling their crops 
 Small farm holdings — no bargaining power 
 Opaque/manipulated prices at Mandis 
 
How to protect against price risk in commodities? 
A producer of a commodity is at risk of prices moving lower. Conversely, a consumer of a 
commodity is a t risk of prices moving higher. The producers and consumers of 
commodities can participate in the commodity derivatives exchange to protect against 
adverse price movements. The process of protecting against financial loss or price risk is 
called "Hedging''. A hedge will guarantee a consumer the supply of a required commodity 
at a set price and a producer the known price for commodity output.

 Price discovery : Helps producers / sellers and consumers / buyers and also 
exporters & importers of a commodity to discover price for a future date and helps  
them take informed decision. 
 Price risk management : Helps hedge price ris k or insure against adverse price 
movement and locks-in profit margin. 
 
Commodity Derivative Exchanges 
A commodity derivative exchange is an organized, regulated market that facilitates the 
purchase and sale of contracts whose values are linked to the price of commodities (e.g., 
wheat, barley, crude oil, gold, etc.). 
 
Typically, the buyers of these contracts agree to accept delivery of a commodity at a price 
on a future date, and similarly, the sellers agree to deliver the commodity at a price on a 
future date. 
 
For example, in case of Agricultural commodities, Commodity Derivatives Exchange helps 
in reducing the price risk, both for the farmers (seller of crop) and the consumer (buyers 
of crop /food processors) by helping them decide a price today (i.e. at the time of sowing 
or at the time of harvesting of the crop) for the crop to be delivered in the future. The 
transaction in the exchange is done through commodity brokers. The settlement of 
contract to buy and sell is guaranteed by the commodity derivatives exchange. 
 
The trading rules and procedures of recognized Commodity Derivatives Exchange s and 
Commodity Brokers are regulated by Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) — a 
statutory body established under SEBI Act, 1992. In India, major commodity derivative 
exchanges are as follows: 
 
 Multi Commodity Exchange of India Ltd (MCX) — predominantly non-agricultural 
products like gold, silver, aluminium, copper, nickel, lead, zinc and energy products like 
crude oil and natural gas are traded on this exchange. 
 
 National Com modity and Derivative Exchange  (NCDEX) — predominantly 
agricultural products like pulses, cereals, sugar, etc. are traded on this exchange. 
 
There are three types of contracts in commodity derivatives market. These are Forward 
Contracts, Futures Contract and Options. Forward contract is an agreement between 
two parties to sell or buy a certain commodity at a fixed price in the future. This contract 
hedges the risk for the buyer against price fluctuations and the seller can get a guaranteed 
price for his product at a specified date. 
 
Forward contracts are traded over the counter, while futures contracts are traded on the 
commodity derivatives exchanges. Forward contracts can be privately negotiated. Futures 
contract have a standardized way o f execution and the transaction is guaranteed by the 
clearing house of a recognized commodity derivative exchange which minimizes the risk 
of defaults on the settlement of transaction.

For example, if A has the machinery that produces 10 bales of cotton, h e can secure an 
agreement with B to sell the bales at a certain price after a year irrespective of the price 
that is trending. This is called hedging the risk. "A" hedges the risk by securing the price 
and "B" transacts by pre-booking the price expecting that prices would go up in the near 
future which would benefit him. The payment and delivery of the asset is made on the 
future date termed as the delivery date. The buyer in the futures contract is known to hold 
a long position. The seller in the futures contracts is said to be having short position. 
 
An options contract refers to the financial instrument which gives the buyer of the option 
the right but not the obligation to exercise the option at a predetermined date at a 
predetermined price. Options contracts are of two types as explained below: 
 
 Call Option: Call option gives one the right to buy the underlying security 
 
 Put Option: Put option gives one the right to sell the underlying security 
                        
Investors are charged a premium when  they buy an options contract. On expiry of the 
contract, generally the transaction is cash settled instead of actually buying/selling the 
underlying security unlike in the cash market. Hence, many investors find Futures & 
Options (F&O) cheaper to trade, h owever, it is riskier than the cash segment because 
F&O is time dependent and you cannot hold on to the contract till the desired time i.e. 
when the market is favourable to earn positive returns. On the expiry of the contract, even 
if you cash settle the c ontract instead of taking delivery, the change in value of the 
underlying will be either credited or debited to your account. 
 
How does a farmer do trading in Commodity Derivatives Market? 
 To deal with the legal/ logistics/ quality requirements of Derivati ves Markets farmers 
would have to form a society/ trust/ Farmers Producing Organization (FPO), etc. 
 Collectively they would have to deposit their produce in the warehouse of the 
Exchange. 
 Quality of the produce for the purpose of standardization to be assa yed (checked / 
tested) by Exchange recognized assayers. 
 Exchange would issue a warehouse receipt (Loans can be obtained from banks 
against these receipts). Exchanges assume responsibility for maintaining the quality 
of the product for a certain period of time. 
 The depositors now have time to check the prices (on the exchange) at which they can 
profitably sell the produce. 
 When the desired price is likely to be realized, the bid is placed at the exchange. Once 
the order matches with the purchaser's bid, the trade is concluded. 
 Farmers have to give delivery on the Exchange platform. 
 Funds are given to the farmers upon satisfactory delivery of the commodity.

Retirement Planning 
The transition into retirement is a very unique and dramatic step in life. Yet, the transition 
into retirement is rarely given the planning or thought it deserves. Everyone wants to lead 
a comfortable retirement life. Without adequate planning it probably won't happen. 
 
Key Features of Retirement Planning 
 
 Start early and retire with financial security: If you start saving for retirement at 
age 25, so that you wish to retire by 60, you can invest over 35 years. 
 Plan wisely : Set aside some money for medical expenditure and emergency 
needs after retirement. Allocate your savings towards important financial goals 
such as children's education and marriage. 
 Track and review your plan:  The financial plan ha s to be reviewed at regular 
intervals to make sure that the plan meets its objectives. Also, you need to 

Financial Education Booklet 
43 | P a g e  
 
understand and get comfortable with the risks, costs and liquidity of your 
investments. 
 Don't dip into your retirement savings:  Don't touch this pool o f savings pre—
retirement. If you spend money from your retirement kitty to fulfil your present 
needs, you will lose out big in the long run. The corpus for your retirement will be 
inadequate. 
 
Estate Planning 
Estate planning refers to planning during one' s lifetime, 
earmarking one's assets to beneficiaries, typically family 
members, loved ones and institutions, so that they can 
be used/ claimed after one's demise with ease, and 
without any significant cost. Making a "Will" is an 
essential part of estate pl anning. Following are the 
constituents of estate planning: 
 
Will 
It is a written legal declaration of desires to distribute assets of the deceased after his or 
her demise. This way one can transfer assets to loved ones, according to his or her 
preferences. By making a Will, one can avoid any feud among beneficiaries over 
distribution of assets. Making a Will is a simple process. 
 
How to make a Will? 
 Make a list of movable and immovable items. 
 Decide which asset shall be given to whom (partially of fully). 
 Mention the name and details of the person who will execute the Will. 
 Preferably, get the Will witnessed by a doctor and lawyer as it gives authenticity to the 
Will. 
 Registration of Will is not compulsory, but preferable. 
 You may write the Will on plain paper or take the help of your lawyer in making a Will. 
 
Problems Arising in the Absence of a Will 
 Beneficiaries of the distribution of assets and the quantum of benefits to them don’t  
happen in the way you would have liked. 
 Asset distribution happens as per personal laws/relationships. 
 May lead to expensive litigation among beneficiaries and other claimants. 
 Succession disputes could take years to resolve and can be costly. Even in the absence 
of disputes, the resolution process can be costly and reduce the benefits of the assets 
inherited. 
 
Nomination 
A nominee is a person who receives the right to have custody of the money on the death 
of the account holder. A nominee is only a custodian of the asset owner's money and 

Financial Education Booklet 
44 | P a g e  
 
doesn't have any ownership rights. In th e absence of nomination, it could be expensive 
and time consuming for the legal heirs of the deceased to get their money. Is nomination 
mandatory in case of a Demat account as well? It is not mandatory but advisable; 
nomination alleviates the problems faced by legal heirs in case of death of account holder. 
One should always remember to fill in the nomination details while opening any account. 
 
For example, Suresh invests in an FD and nominates his friend, Ramesh as his nominee 
of his bank FD. On Suresh's death, Ramesh receives the money as his nominee. Ramesh 
needs to subsequently transfer the entire amount to Suresh's legal heirs; otherwise his 
heirs will need to claim the amount in the court of Law. 
 
Power of Attorney 
Power of attorney is a legal document that allows another person to act on your behalf. It 
ensures that important matters are dealt with by someone you trust if you are unable to 
deal with them yourself. 
 
If you aren't able to personally accomplish a task, you may grant someone else — the 
power to do it for you. This permission can include things like accessing your bank 
accounts, selling a vehicle, purchasing property or getting a home loan. In fact, your power 
of attorney can grant your agent the authority to conduct nearly any type of Trans action 
you could conduct on your behalf. 
 
The person who grants power  of attorney  to an agent is called the principal, and the 
principal may use either a general power of attorney or special power of attorney to give 
power to his or her agent. (Agent means many people to whom the power is given by the 
principal to act on the behalf of the principal). A general power of attorney gives the agent 
power to accomplish anything the principal could do, whereas a special power of attorney 
gives the agent limited powers, such as the power to accomplish a specific transaction. 
 
Procedure to transfer person's wealth and assets after his or her 
death 
After the demise of an individual, his or her legal heirs have to approach various authorities 
(like banks, depositories,  mutual fund companies and Insurance companies) with their 
claim on the deceased assets. They have to present the death certificate along with legal 
heir's certificate to these authorities to transfer the assets of the deceased in their name. 
 
If the decea sed has made a Will, the assets and the wealth of the deceased will be 
distributed as per his or her Will. In the absence of a Will, the transfer will be made only 
to legal heirs.

5 Cs in Credit — One Stop Guide to get your Loan Sanctioned 
The banks generally follow a conservative approach for processing the loan request of the 
borrowers. In this analysis, banks consider five elements and these are known as 5 Cs in 
credit. These are as follows: 
 
Capacity: The prospective lender will want to know exactly how you intend to and what 
is your capacity to repay the loan. 
 
Character: Lender will form a subjective opinion as to whether or not you are sufficiently 
trustworthy to repay the loan or generate a return on funds invested in your company. 
 
Capital: Capital is the money you personally have invested in the business and is an 
indication of how much you have at risk, should the business fail. 
 
Collateral: Bank s insist on taking a security in addition to that is created out of loan 
proceeds. 
 
Conditions: Banks analyse the intended purpose of availing the loan like will the money 
be used for working capital, additional equipment or inventory, among others. 
 
Credit Score 
Credit information agencies play a vital role in decision making in loan application process. 
After an applicant fills out the application form and hands it over to the lender, the lender 
first checks the credit score and credit report of the applicant. If the credit score is low, the 
lender may not even consider the application further and reject it at that point. If the credit 
score is high, the lender will look into the application and consider other details to 
determine if the applicant is credit-worthy. The credit score works as a first impression for 
the lender, the higher the score, the better are your chances of the loan being reviewed 
and approved. The decision to lend is solely dependent on the lender and credit score or

credit report does not in any manner decide if the loan or credit card should be sanctioned 
or not. 
 
Credit Information Bureau (India) Ltd (CIBIL) is India's first credit information company, 
also commonly referred as a credit bureau. CIBIL collects and maintains records of 
individuals' and non -individuals' (commercial entities) payments pertaining to loans and 
credit cards. These records are submitted to CIBIL by banks and other lenders on a 
monthly basis; using this information a Credit Information Report (CIR) and credit score is 
developed, enabling lenders to evaluate and approve loan applications. A credit bureau is 
licensed by the RBI and governed by the Credit Information Companies (Regulation) Act 
of 2005. The Reserve Bank of India requires all credit bureaus to give o ne free full credit 
report, every year, to all consumers. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
Tips to Avoid ‘Debt Trap’ 
Tip 01: Debt can be managed with the right mind set and discipline. Do not buy more 
than what you can afford. Do not get lured into ‘WANT’ items. 
Tip 02: Getting the maximum mortgage loan tenure does not necessarily mean we need 
to take as long to repay. 
Tip 03: Realize that credit cards should only be used to facilitate payment and not as a 
means to borrow money. 
Tip 04: Never treat credit cards as free money. 
Tip 05: Stop all the activities that result in debt. Change your lifestyle to accumulate more 
savings. 
Tip 06: Use a debit card instead of a credit card. It eliminates the risk of spending beyond 
your means. 
Tip 07: Spend within your means, buy things you can afford to pay.

Chapter 11  - Caution against Ponzi Schemes and  
Unregistered Investment Advisers 
 
Ponzi Schemes 
Ponzi Schemes are named after Charles Ponzi, who 
constructed one such scheme at the beginning of the 20th 
century. Of course the concept was well known prior to 
Ponzi’s rise to infamy. A Ponzi scheme is a f raudulent 
investment scheme promising high rates o f return to 
investors. The scheme generates returns for earlier  
investors from their own money or money paid by subsequent investors, rather than any 
actual profit earned. The perpetuation of the returns that a Ponzi scheme advertises and 
pays requires an ever-increasing flow of money from investors to keep the scheme going.  
 
The Ponzi scheme usually attract new investors by offering returns that other investments 
cannot guarantee, in the form of short -term returns that are either abnormally high or 
unusually consistent. As more investors become involved, the likelihood of the scheme 
coming to the attention of authorities increases. It has been the typical experience that 
promoter then vanishes, taking all the remaining investors' money. Such schemes typically 
collapse under their own weight as fresh investments slow down and the promoter starts 
having problems paying the promised returns. 
 
The system is destined to collapse because the earnings, if any, are less than the 
payments to investors. Sometimes, the authorities are able to clamp down on such 
schemes before they collapse because they act on suspicion of a scheme being a Ponzi 
scheme. 
 
How to spot one? 
Here are few tips that help you to spot a Ponzi scheme: 
 
High returns with little or no risk 
Every investment carries some degree of risk. Higher the return, higher is the risk involved. 
Be highly suspicious of any guaranteed high return investment opportunity. 
 
Overly consistent returns 
Investments tend to go up and down over time. Be sceptical about an investment that 
regularly gives positive returns regardless of overall market conditions. 
 
Unregistered investments 
Ponzi schemes typically involve investment schemes that are not registered with the 
regulators or any government agency for their activity. Registration is important because 
it provides investors with access to information about the company's management, 
products, services and finances. 

Financial Education Booklet 
56 | P a g e  
 
Unlicensed sellers 
Any investment scheme requires to be r egistered with concerned authority and state 
securities laws require investment professionals and firms to be licensed or registered. 
Most Ponzi schemes involve unlicensed individuals or unregistered firms. 
 
Non-transparent disclosure 
Avoid investments if you don't understand them or can't get complete information about 
them. Account statement errors may be a sign that funds are not being invested as 
promised. 
 
Difficulty in receiving payments 
Be suspicious if you don't receive a payment or have difficulty cashing out. Ponzi scheme 
promoters sometimes try to prevent participants from cashing out by offering even higher 
returns for staying invested. 
 
 
 
Protection from fraud 
Recently, in India, many of the investors lost money because of the operation of 
unregistered entities offering investment schemes. The Sharada Chit Fund Scam in West 
Bengal and the illegal mobilization of funds by Sahara firms are relevant examples. One 
needs to caution himself or herself about the operation of fraudulent agencies luring 
investors by offering higher returns within a short period. You can keep your money safe 
by being aware of these risks.

Caution against Unregistered Investment Advisers 
SEBI registers Investment Advisers under SEBI (Investment Advisers) Regulations, 2013 
[Last amended on July 03, 2020]. "Investment Adviser" means any person, who for 
consideration, is engaged in the business of providing investment advice to clients or other 
persons or group of persons and includes any person who holds out himself as an 
investment adviser, by whatever name called. 
 
The aim of the Regulation is to regulate "investment advice" which refers to advice relating 
to investing in, purchasing, selling or otherwise dealing in securities or investment 
products, and advice on investment portfolio containing securities or investment products, 
whether written, verbal or through any other means of communication for the benefit of 
the client and shall include financial planning: Provided that investment advice given 
through newspaper, maga zines, any electronic or broadcasting or telecommunications

58 | P a g e  
 
medium, which is widely available to the public shall not be considered as investment 
advice for the purpose of these regulations. Investment Advisers are supposed to obtain 
registration from SEBI and follow the Code of Conduct. 
 
It is illegal to act as Investment Adviser without SEBI registration. SEBI is making 
concerted efforts to stop such illegal activity. Some unscrupulous and ignorant entities 
may not get themselves registered and, or, may n ot follow the Code of Conduct. 
Investment Advisers have to limit themselves to giving advice and they should not handle 
cash or securities. 
 
Some of the malpractices in connection with the activities of registered and unregistered 
entities acting as Investment Advisers (IA), as reported to SEBI comprise of the following:  
 Assured returns being offered by the investment advisers to the clients. 
 Charging exorbitant fees from client with a false promise of handsome returns. 
 Mis-selling by IA without adhering to the risk profile of the client, to earn higher fees. 
On receiving complaints for refund of fees from client for loss incurred, IA offer higher 
risk products to clients with a promise that they will recover their losses. 
 Trading on behalf of the clients. 
 Automatically upgrading or changing the service to higher risk products, not matching 
with the client profile and without the consent of the client. 
 Poor service by the IA causing loss of money to the clients.  
 Refund related issues. 
 
Investors therefore n eed to be aware and guard themselves against above mentioned 
practices present in the market and deal with caution with entities claiming expertise in 
capital markets. Investors are advised to take advice for investment only from entities 
registered under SEBI (Investment Adviser) Regulations, 2013 [Last amended on July 03, 
2020]. 
 
The list of such entities is available at the following website: https://www.sebi.gov.in.

of India in 1992 to protect the interests of investors and to regulate and develop the Indian 
securities market. It started operations in 1988 through an order of Government of India.

regulation of various intermediaries in the securities market and protection of the interests 
of investors. It is head quartered in Mumbai with regional offices in Delhi, Kolkata, Chennai 
and Ahmedabad and various local offices across different States. 
 
Buying and selling of shares takes place in the stock exchanges through stock brokers. 
These intermediaries in securities market can function only if they are registered with 
SEBI. They are also required to follow the rules, regulations and guidelines laid down by 
SEBI to protect the investors. Similarly, SEBI also regulates other participants in the 
capital market like stock exchanges, brokers, depositories, depository participant s, 
portfolio managers, merchant bankers, share transfer agents, etc. 
 
Mutual funds collect money from different investors and then invest that money in various 
schemes as per the choice of the investors. They are governed by rules formulated by 
SEBI. Mutual Funds have to disclose details of the scheme, where they will invest money, 
the fees charged from the investor, etc. They also have to make periodic disclosures for 
the benefits of investors as mandated by SEBI. SEBI also educates investors and 
facilitates redressal of their grievances.
