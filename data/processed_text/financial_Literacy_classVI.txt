1.1 Defining Team Work
A team is defined as a group of people joined together to perform a common goal or 
objective. Teams can be formed in playgrounds, schools and colleges. 
When members of a team perform some work together, it is known as teamwork. The 
highlight of teamwork is that it is a result of individuals working together in collabora -
tion. 
Tasks that may be challenging otherwise can be made simpler and achievable with the 
use of teams. When a team works together, each member is able to contribute on the 
basis of his or her unique set of competencies. 
Team output is a result of various individuals contributing uniquely and distinctly yet for 
a common purpose.
1.2 Team Skills
Teams are a wonderful way for individuals to come together and achieve common 
goals. However, for this to happen, it is important for the team members to possess 
and demonstrate specific skills. Let us learn about the kind of skills that are required 
for teams to work effectively:
• Communication Skills: Team members should have the ability to listen attentively 
and also put across their own thoughts and viewpoints.
• Interpersonal Skills: Teams work well when there is harmony within the members, 
and that becomes possible with the demonstration of interpersonal skills.
• Feedback Skills: Giving and receiving feedback are essential skills for teams to 
work. It involves being able to communicate improvement points to other members 
while also being able to receive feedback calmly and gracefully.
• Conflict Resolution: It is normal for differences to arise among team members. 
It is therefore important for members to be able to demonstrate conflict resolution 
skills so that these differences can be sorted out peacefully, and teamwork is not 
impacted.

1.3 Teams and Groups 
How is a team different from a group? Even a group consists of individuals who have 
common characteristics. However, they may or may not be tied to a common goal or 
objective. It is an important aspect that differentiates a ‘Team’ from a ‘Group’.
Let’s take an example of a team you form while playing a sport such as football. All 
the team members are driven by the common goal of winning against the other team.

1.4 Benefits of Team Work
When individuals join together as a team, this leads to various benefits such as:
• Higher Productivity: Humans are essentially social beings, and when they work 
together, they tend to work faster and more effectively.
• Better Cooperation: Working as a team enables improved levels of cooperation 
amongst the members as they are able to learn from each other’s mistakes and 
provide support where required.
• Creativity and Problem Solving:  Teamwork provides opportunities for all mem-
bers to take advantage of their unique skill-set and propose new creative approach-
es to solve challenges.
• Sharing of Work: When a set of people work as a team, the work burden gets di-
vided amongst the members, and there is reduced risk of stress on any individual.
• Learning and Motivation: Everyone in the team is able to learn new things from 
one another, and this also keeps everyone motivated and focused on the goals.
Summary
• A team is defined as a group of people who are joined together to perform a 
common goal or objective
• When members of a team perform some work together, it is known as teamwork
• There are specific skills that are required to make teams work effectively and 
each team member contributes uniquely to achieve the common purpose

2.1 Understanding basic financial concepts
Money Money is a recognised medium of exchange in the economy.  It is an asset that can 
be stored and used in the form of currency, or as value.
Currency Currency is the physical form of money in the form of coins and rupees. Each country 
typically has its own currency as a medium of exchange, issued by the central bank. 
In India, the Government of India (GoI) and Reserve Bank of India (RBI) are the issu-
ers of the currency, i.e. Indian Rupees
Bank A bank is a government authorised financial institution which acts as a custodian of 
money deposited by account holders and uses the collected funds to extend loans to 
individuals and businesses while charging interest on the same. 
Account An account is a repository of the funds held by a bank on behalf of the account hold-
er. An account can be of various kinds, and is identified by a unique account number 
issued to the account holder.
Saving Savings is the amount of money that is remaining from income, after the expenses 
are made.
Investment An investment refers to an asset acquired with the objective of generating income or 
appreciation.
When you accompany your parents to the market, do you observe how they purchase 
the various items? Every purchase requires the use of money. 
As you are able to observe, money is the accepted medium of exchange. It allows 
you to buy the things you require, right from basic things such as bread to high-value 
products such as a car.
In our country, money is used in the form of Indian currency known as ‘Rupee’. You 
would surely have used ‘rupees’ when you buy food from the school canteen.

2.2 Barter System
Historically speaking, humans have been transacting in goods much before money 
was invented. Have you ever wondered how these transactions took place?
The answer is ‘Barter System’. To understand the Barter System in a simple manner, 
consider this example:
Satya has two bags of wheat at his home; however, he needs only one of them for his 
monthly consumption. On the other hand, Ahmad has two bags of rice out of which he 
is able to spare one. So they meet and decide to exchange the bag of wheat with that 
of rice. After the barter exchange, Satya and Ahmad both have one bag of rice and 
wheat each to match their requirement of food.
Have you ever performed a simple barter exchange with your friend or cousin? For 
example, you have a pack of sketch pens that you do not need, and you exchange the 
same for a geometry box?
Page 12
 Central Board of Secondary Education
2.3 Needs and Wants
To better understand the Barter System, it is important to know the meaning of ‘Needs’ 
and ‘Wants’. In the Satya-Ahmad example, we can see that while Satya needs rice to 
meet the food requirements of his family, Ahmad needs a bag of wheat for the same 
purpose. However, rice and wheat are not their ‘wants’.
Let us try to understand the same through another example. When you feel hungry, 
you need food to satisfy your hunger. Therefore, food is your need. However, when 
you visit the market with your father and you feel tempted to have ice cream. In this 
situation, ice cream is not your ‘need.’ However, it is your ‘want.’
‘Needs’ are the essential requirements in our life such as food, clothes and house. On 
the other hand, ‘Wants’ are for the things you require to enhance the quality of your 
life, such as games, music and TVs.
2.4 Evolution of Trade 
Let us start by understanding the definition of trade.  Trade is a financial activity that 
includes buying and selling various goods and services between two or more people 
involved in the transaction. Trade can happen between organisations and countries 
as well. For example, India primarily exports products such as rice and jewellery, and 
imports petroleum and electronic components.

Central Board of Secondary Education
 Page 13
The evolution of trade across the world has been closely linked with the development 
of the money system. You would be surprised to know that trade across continents has 
been prevalent in our world, even in ancient times.
While ancient trade was based on the barter system, there is also evidence of com-
modities being used in the form of livestock, salt, metal, rare stones et cetera.
Pottery traditions were popular in parts of the world such as Japan, Korea, China, 
Mexico and many more. The Han Dynasty, which ruled China from 206 BC to 220 
AD, opened up the ‘Silk Road’ trading route between China and Central Asia. Various 
kinds of merchandise travelled along the Silk Road, making it one of the oldest routes 
of international trade in the world. 
The first non-stop voyages from Egypt to India were initiated at the start of the Com-
mon Era. Spices from India came in demand around the world and were the main 
exports to the western world. The spice trade led to new diplomatic  
relationships between East and West. It was partly with the spice  
trade in mind that Christopher set out in 1492 and discovered America.

3.1 Evolution of Money
As you can see that a Barter-like exchange system has its limitations and only works 
when you have something to offer that the other person needs and vice versa. It may 
not always be the situation. The limitations of the Barter System led to the evolution 
of money.
As you may be aware, gold coins were used as a mode of currency in ancient India. 
Similarly, different regions in the world have been us-
ing other precious/semi-precious products as a unit 
of trade.
For example, the ancient Aztecs used beans as a 
trade currency, and Norwegians used butter. Simi-
larly, US colonists used tobacco leaves and animal 
hides as a form of currency.
Gradually, however, as human civilisation pro-
gressed, coins and currency notes came into circu-
lation. In fact, the development of currency has been 
representative of the development level of an econ-
omy across ages.

Central Board of Secondary Education
 Page 17
The earliest coins were made in the kingdom of Lydia (now in Turkey) in the 7th cen-
tury BC. The use of coins spread rapidly across the world from Lydia to the Africa and 
Europe. The transition to paper currency is said to have occurred in China during the 
10th century.
In ancient India too, metal coins came into circulation around the 6th century BC. 
Paper currency is said to have been introduced in India by the Mughals in the year  
1236 AD.
3.2 Banks and their Importance
As a young child, you may have used a piggy bank. You deposit a small amount of 
cash or coins into a piggy bank, and when you open it finally, it reveals a handsome 
amount for you to use. That is how a bank works in real life too. However, it works 
according to strict rules and also serves many more functions that are important to 
individuals and businesses.
To explain in simple words, a bank is an institution where people deposit their funds as 
savings and are able to withdraw the same when required. In this sense, a bank acts 
as a ‘vault’ for safekeeping of funds. There are situations when people may need funds 
more than their savings to purchase high-value products such as cars, bikes et cetera. 
In such situations, banks also provide ‘loan’ to the ‘deposit holders’.

Page 18

3.3 Origins of Banking
In ancient human history, banking is said to have started in the temples and palaces of 
Babylonia even before 2000 BC. Ancient Greeks too developed a system of transfer-
ring money in the form of book entries.
Banking in India started in a major way in the form of the Imperial Bank of India in 
1921. This was later renamed as the State Bank of India (SBI) in 1955. 
3.4 Types of Banks
Banks are of different types and can be categorised on the basis of their ownership 
and services they offer:
Central Bank: The Central Bank is an extremely important institution in the financial 
system of any country. In India, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) plays the role of the 
central bank. It is responsible for the overall management of the nation’s currency to 
ensure an adequate supply of genuine notes. As the central bank, RBI also performs 
various other important functions such as acting as a banker to the government and 
implementing monetary policies for the country. 

Central Board of Secondary Education
 Page 19
Commercial Banks: These include public sector banks owned by the Government 
and also the private banks. Commercial banks provide a direct interface to the people 
allowing them to open and manage accounts, to obtain loans and other financial ser-
vices.
3.5 Opening a Bank Account
A bank account can be opened in the name of an individual singly or jointly with a fam-
ily member by submitting the following documents:
• Passport size photographs
• Identity proof
• Address proof
• Opening amount 
Once the account is opened, the bank provides to the account holder an account 
number and cheque book to operate the account. Some banks also provide account 
holders with access to mobile banking.
3.6 Types of Bank Accounts

Page 20
 Central Board of Secondary Education
Savings Account: TThese are the accounts opened in banks with the key purpose 
of inculcating the habit of saving among people. Savings accounts allow maximum 
flexibility to deposit any amount of their liking, thus making it easy and convenient for 
common people. This kind of account is popular with students, salaried individuals, 
and senior citizens. Savings accounts earn a nominal interest which is based on the 
time period the funds are parked in the account.
Current Account: These accounts are opened by business owners as they meet their 
requirement for an unlimited number of cash deposits and withdrawals. The important 
thing to note in case of current accounts is that they do not earn interest. On the other 
hand, banks charge interest from account holders for an overdraft facility. When banks 
allow account holders to withdraw more than their account balance in order to meet 
their business requirements, it is known as an overdraft.
 
Fixed Deposit: This account type is ideal for depositors who wish to park their funds 
in the bank for a long period of time. The key benefit of fixed deposit is that it provides 
a substantially higher rate of interest compared to savings accounts.
Recurring Deposit: Very popular with students, recurring deposits are designed to 
encourage the habit of regular savings amongst people. These deposits too earn in-
terest higher than savings accounts. An example of a Recurring Deposit is when a 
depositor plans to deposit a fixed amount of Rs.1000 per month for a period of 24 
months. On the completion of the 24 months period, the depositor gets back the base 
amount of Rs. 24,000, along with the interest amount.
3.7 Cheque ﹘ an instrument of exchange
Cheques have been the most popular instrument for money transfer for many de-
cades. Although today more and more people are using the option of online banking, 
yet cheques continue to remain at the very core of the banking industry.
Central Board of Secondary Education
 Page 21
Let us understand through a simple example of how cheques work. Let us suppose 
that you have Rs.25,000 in your bank account in Bank A. You wish to pay Rs.5000 to 
Ajay using a cheque. 
1. You issue a cheque of Rs.5000 to Ajay using the Bank A cheque book
2. Ajay deposits the cheque in his bank, say Bank B
3. Bank B sends the cheque to Bank A
4. Bank A sends the amount of Rs.5000 to Bank B after confirming the cheque  
details
5. Rs.5000 is now deposited to Ajay’s account in Bank B
6. Rs.5000 is reduced from your account in Bank A
Each cheque contains some key elements, which include:
● Name and signature of the person making the payment/account holder
● Name of the person who will receive the payment
● Date on or after which the cheque is valid

4.4.2 Modes of Digital Payments − Card Based
The objective of this section is to make students aware of banking cards, Point of Sale 
(PoS) and ATM machines
In the previous sections, you have learnt about the importance of banks and the vari-
ous services they offer. Apart from cheques, banking cards are also important tools for 
making convenient transactions. Let’s learn about them…
Debit Cards: Debit cards serve a dual purpose. They allow the account holders to 
perform banking transactions through the ATM machine such as deposits, cash with-
drawals and access account information.

Credit Cards: As the name suggests, credit cards are instruments that provide instant 
credit to the cardholders. When a credit card is used for making a transaction, the 
amount is not deducted from the bank account but is provided as credit by the issuing 
bank. The cardholder is provided with a time period; generally a month, to pay back 
the amount to the bank.

Prepaid Cards: These are ‘stored value’ cards that are charged with a specific amount. 
The prepaid cardholder is allowed to transact for the value stored in the card. For ex-
ample, if the card has a value of Rs.5000, once that value is used up for purchases, 
more value needs to be added to the card.

Guidelines for the use of banking cards
Instruments like debit, credit and prepaid cards indeed offer a high level of conve-
nience while making transactions; however, all the same, it is also important to follow 
guidelines during their use.
• One must be observant while using an ATM card to withdraw cash. Ensure that 
there is no other person who may be watching while you enter the PIN
• Credit cards should be used only for convenience, and the cardholder must ensure 
to pay back the card dues in time to avoid the heavy interest
• Banking cards must be kept very safe and not allowed to go into wrong hands to 
avoid misuse
• Card PIN numbers must not be shared with anyone

4.5 Various channels for acceptance of card based digital 
payments 
4.5.1 Point of Sale (PoS)
PoS is a system that automatically keeps track of each sale transaction and the amount 
received from the customer. It also enables card based transactions.
4.5.2 mPoS - Mobile Point of Sale
Unlike traditional PoS, mPoS provides great technological advantages. It is a mobile 
phone-based application that is designed for simple use by the merchant. With an 
extremely intuitive interface, the menus and functions on an mPoS are easy to use. 
4.5.3 Soft PoS
Soft PoS is an innovative payment acceptance segment, which uses ‘Tap-on-Phone’ 
technology. This technology allows merchants to accept payment from contactless 
cards directly on their Near Field Communication (NFC)-enabled android mobile de-
vices via software based payment application, without the requirement for any addi -
tional connected hardware. 
4.5.4 E-commerce payment
Whenever there is a purchase of goods and services online through an electronic 
medium without the use of cash or cheques, it is known as e-commerce payment. You 
might have observed your parents purchasing things online using their smartphone 
with the help of a mobile application. That is a popular example of E-commerce.
E-commerce payment offers various benefits in the form of:
• Security
• Efficiency
• Convenience
• User-friendliness

4.5.5 Automated Teller Machines (ATMs)
ATMs enable bank account holders to withdraw cash, check balance, and do other 
banking transactions at their own convenient time without the need of bank staff in-
volvement.
ATM ‒ Benefits to Customers
On the same lines, ATMs offer a host of benefits to the customers/account holders. 
These include:
1. Reduced visits to the bank branch
2. Shorter travel time as ATMs are situated nearby
3. Convenient access to cash 24x7
4. Additional services such as balance inquiry, mini statement, PIN change, etc.
5. With ATM being interoperable, customers can visit any bank ATM to withdraw cash, 
do balance inquiry, PIN change, etc.

4.6.1 Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI)
The government of India has taken a strong step in the direction of securing digital 
transactions through the launch of Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI). 
Launched as a statutory authority in the year 2016, the UIDAI initiative is aimed to-
wards issuing a unique identity document named as ‘Aadhaar’ (also known as UID) to 
all citizens of India. UIDAI’s key objective is to eliminate duplicate and fake identities, 
allowing for individual authentication and verification in an easy and cost-effective way.
4.6.2 Aadhaar Enabled Payment System (AePS)
Aadhaar Enabled Payment System (AePS) is a payment system operated by NPCI. 
AePS empowers a bank customer to access his/her Aadhaar enabled bank account 
to perform basic banking transactions like balance enquiry, cash deposit, cash with-
drawal, mini statement & Aadhaar to Aadhaar fund transfers through a business corre-
spondent. Aadhaar Enabled Payment System (AePS) is a payment system operated

(also known as bank mitras) allowing Aadhaar holders to perform basic banking trans-
actions. Fingerprint and/or Retina/Iris of the customer are used to authenticate a cus-
tomer.  Micro ATMs are portable and can be carried anywhere in just one hand. 
4.7 Modes of Digital Payments - Mobile Based Banking and 
Others
The objective of this section is to enable students to learn about the various forms of 
digital payments including internet banking, mobile banking, and digital platforms such 
as UPI and mobile wallets. 
4.7.1 Internet Banking
Internet banking allows you to transact on your bank account over the internet using 
your laptop, tablet or smartphone. When you transfer an amount using Internet Bank-
ing, it can be done through different methods, including:
• National Electronic Fund Transfer (NEFT)
• Real-Time Gross Settlement (RTGS)
• Immediate Payment Service (IMPS)
National Electronic Fund Transfer (NEFT)
National Electronic Funds Transfer (NEFT) is a nation-wide centralised payment sys-
tem owned and operated by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI).  The payment mode 
enables companies and individuals to transfer funds electronically to other companies 
and individuals. 
Central Board of Secondary Education
 Page 35
The account holder needs to register the beneficiary account details such as account 
holder name, account type (savings etc.), account number and Indian Financial Sys-
tem Code (IFSC) which helps to identify individual bank branches. 
Real-Time Gross Settlement (RTGS)
RTGS is a real-time settlement system which allows for fast processing of money 
transfer between any two accounts. ‘Real Time’ means the processing of instructions 
at the time they are received; ‘Gross Settlement’ means that the settlement of funds 
transfer instructions occurs individually. The payments made via RTGS are final and 
irrevocable.
The RTGS system is primarily meant for large value transactions. The minimum 
amount to be remitted through RTGS is ₹ 2,00,000/- with no upper limit.
 
Immediate Payment Service (IMPS)
IMPS is a product made available by the National Payments Corporation of India 
(NPCI). It allows for 24x7 instant funds transfer service that can be accessed on mul-
tiple channels like Mobile, Internet, ATM and SMS.
The key feature of IMPS is that it is available at all times. The transaction fee for IMPS 
is nominal, and it allows a transfer limit of Rupees 2 lakhs per transaction.

QR Codes, an Easy Way to Pay
The UPI interface makes it extremely easy and convenient to make payments using 
the Quick Response codes or QR codes. When you accompany your parents to the 
market, you may have observed them making payments through QR codes. Let us 
see how that works:
• The customer scans the UPI QR placed at merchant locations / generated on PoS
• Customer verifies the transaction details like UPI ID, amount, merchant name, etc. 
and provides confirmation 
• The UPI PIN needs to be entered
• Successful payment confirmation is received on the UPI App along with SMS con-
firmation on mobile
4.7.3 Mobile Wallets, the Smart Way to Make Payments
In today’s time, if a person walks out to the market without his cash and banking cards, 
yet he/she is able to purchase things of choice, how is that made possible?
As the name suggests, a mobile wallet is a virtual wallet in the form of a mobile app 
that allows you to make purchases simply by scanning the QR code at the merchant

establishment. A popular example of a mobile wallet in use today is PayTM. 
4.7.4 Unstructured Supplementary Service Data (USSD)
Unstructured Supplementary Service Data (USSD) allows users without a smartphone 
or data/internet connection to use facilities such as mobile banking by using the *99# 
code. The key objective of this innovative technology is to allow financial inclusion of 
the less privileged sections of the society and integrate them into mainstream banking.
