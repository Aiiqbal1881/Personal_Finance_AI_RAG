Indian Household Financial Decisions – Tarun 
Ramadorai  
• Four broad features visible in the All-India Debt and Investment  Survey, 
2012: 
 
• High allocation to non-financial assets (gold and real estate). 
 
• High levels of non-institutional-source borrowing. 
 
•  Near complete lack of pensions. 
 
• Low levels of insurance penetration (life and non-life).

Financial assets Retirement accounts 
► The average Indian household holds 77% of total assets in real estate, 11% in gold,  
5% in financial assets, 7% in durable goods ( vehicles, livestock, agriculture 
machinery etc.) and hardly any retirement assets/pensions.

is unsecured (55%). 
 
Saving and investments options  
  
• Banks   
• Savings Bank Account, Fixed Deposit and Recurring Deposit  
• Tax implications : The interest that you receive from a savings account is taxable 
under the head “Income from other sources”.  
• Further, Section 80TTA provides for a deduction up to Rs 10,000 on such interest 
income and therefore, interest earned beyond Rs 10,000 only is taxable.  
• Post office Schemes  
• Recurring Deposit, Time Deposit, and Monthly Income Scheme  
• Small Savings Scheme  
• Public Provident Fund, Sukanya Samriddhi Yojana, Senior Citizen’s saving scheme , 
National Savings Certificate, Kisan Vikas Patra, PM Vaya Vandana yojana 
• Insurance  
• Health and other insurance  
• Life Insurance  
 
Saving and investments options  
  
• Pension 
• Pension and annuity  
• National Pension System  
• Atal Pension Yojana  
• Other Investments 
• Stocks and Equity  
• Mutual Funds  
• Company deposits  
• Capital Gains tax exemption bonds  
• Sovereign gold scheme   
• Real estate  
• Gold  
 
 
Saving and investing without some amount of planning and 
projections can be quite useless 
  
• Many people wrongly see real estate as a sound investment option  
 
• Reliance on fixed income alone will not lead to accumulation of 
sufficient wealth when you need it  
 
• For wealth creation, the best asset class is equity  
 
 
Stocks and Equity  
  
• A stock is a share in the ownership of a business  
• Investment objectives   
a) Capital gains – buy low sell high and pocket the difference  
b) Dividends – part of the company profit distributed by the company  
• Stocks have the highest risk and highest potential returns – risk and reward 
go together in Finance  
• Stocks are suitable for investors who have time horizon of five years are 
more to accumulate wealth  
• Stocks are not for less time horizon – day traders etc., and those who lack 
the skill, time, inclination to research the stocks on a regular basis  
• Option – Equity Mutual Funds  
 
Stocks and Equity  
  
• Stocks or mutual funds ?  
• Investing in mutual funds is a better way of getting gains of stock investing 
with lower risk and less hard work as professional managers do the 
investment for you  
• Mutual funds however carry fees and certain limitations depending on the 
fund  
• Sophisticated investors may not like passive investing in mutual funds  
• Invest or trade?  
• Investment is the art of identifying fundamentally sound companies and 
investing in them for long term i.e., fundamentalists  
• Trading is the art of identifying trends in stock prices and trading in them for 
short periods in the hope of large and quick profit i.e., chartists  
 
Stocks and Equity  
  
• There are no guaranteed returns on stock investments  
• Stocks are liquid investments – they can be sold at any time during the 
trading hours and money is realised within three days   
• All trading is done through a stockbroker who is a member of stock 
exchange  
• Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE)  https://www.bseindia.com/  
• National Stock Exchange (NSE) https://www.nseindia.com/ 
• Basic prerequisite to trade is to have a DEMAT account – just like a bank 
account it holds stocks instead of cash – two depositories are there – NSDL 
and CDSL – stock broker will help open an account based on KYC norms  
 
 
Stocks and Equity  
  
• Dividends up to Rs 10 lakhs per year are not taxable in the hands of the 
investor; however they are liable to pay 10% dividend distribution tax 
(DDT) by the company   
• Dividends above Rs 10 lakhs are taxable at the rate of 10%  
• Post deletion of DDT, dividend income will be taxed in the hands of all 
shareholders at applicable tax rates. 
• Capital gains are taxable at 15% is the stock is sold within one year and 
there is a 10% tax on gains exceeding one lakh for stocks sold after an year  
• There is a 0.1% Security Transaction Tax (STT)  on the stock either on sale or 
purchase   
 
Mutual Funds  
  
• Mutual funds combine savings of large pool of investors  and manage 
them as a single pool of money  
• Professional fund managers decide where to invest the money  
• The assets are run by AMC – Asset Management Company  
• Each AMC makes an offer of multiple schemes to cater to different 
type of investment requirements  
• They are highly liquid and withdrawals are easy and take very little 
time

FV1 = PV + INT1 = PV + PV (I) 
 = PV(1 + I) 
 = $100(1.10)

After 2 years 
FV2 = FV1(1+I) = PV(1 + I)(1+I)

Step 2:  Find interest charge for Year 1. 
INTt = Beg balt (I) 
 
INT1 = $1,000(0.10) = $100 
55 
Repmt = PMT - INT 
    = $402.11 - $100 
    = $302.11 
Step 3:  Find repayment of principal in 
Year 1. 
56 
Step 4:  Find ending balance after Year 
1. 
End bal = Beg bal - Repmt 
 = $1,000 - $302.11 = $697.89 
Repeat these steps for Years 2 and 3 
to complete the amortization table.
